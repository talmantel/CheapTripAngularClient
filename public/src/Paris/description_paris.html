                    "description": "Hey there, fellow budget travellers! It's your favourite penny-pinching adventurer, CheapTrip.Guru, here to share some tips on how to experience one of Paris' most iconic landmarks without breaking the bank. That's right, I'm talking about the one and only Notre-Dame Cathedral. Now, I know what you're thinking. But CheapTrip.Guru, isn't Notre-Dame one of the most expensive tourist attractions in Paris? Well, my friends, I'm here to tell you that it doesn't have to be. With a little bit of planning and some insider knowledge, you can see this stunning cathedral without spending a fortune. First things first, let's talk about getting there. The easiest and cheapest way to reach Notre-Dame is by taking the metro. Taking the metro is a great way to experience Paris like a local. Now, onto the main event: visiting Notre-Dame itself. The good news is that admission to the cathedral is completely free! That's right, you can see the stunning stained glass windows, intricate carvings, and soaring ceilings without spending a single euro. Just be prepared to wait in line, as it can get quite crowded during peak tourist season. If you want to take your Notre-Dame experience to the next level, consider climbing the towers. This will give you a breathtaking view of Paris and the chance to get up close and personal with the famous gargoyles. However, there is a fee for this (around 10 euros), so it's up to you to decide if it's worth it. Finally, if you're looking for a souvenir to remember your Notre-Dame visit, skip the overpriced gift shops and head to the nearby Shakespeare and Company bookstore. This iconic shop has been a Parisian institution for over 60 years and is the perfect place to pick up a book or literary-themed gift. So there you have it, folks. CheapTrip.Guru's guide to seeing Notre-Dame Cathedral on a budget. Remember, just because you're travelling on a shoestring doesn't mean you have to miss out on Paris' most famous landmarks. Happy travels!",
