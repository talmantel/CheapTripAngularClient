            Memorial Fountain is another popular attraction, where visitors can cool off in the water and pay tribute to
            the beloved princess.\nHyde Park also offers a variety of activities and experiences for visitors of all
            ages and interests. The park has several playgrounds, including the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial
            Playground, which is inspired by the story of Peter Pan. The park also hosts concerts, festivals, and other
            events throughout the year, such as the Winter Wonderland during the holiday season.\nFor budget travellers,
            Hyde Park is a great place to have a picnic, go for a walk or a run, or simply relax and enjoy the scenery.
            There are plenty of benches and grassy areas to sit and soak up the sun or read a book. The park is also
