            Buckingham Palace: A Royal Experience for Budget Travellers\nLondon is a city that is steeped in history and
            culture, and one of the most iconic landmarks that draws millions of visitors every year is Buckingham
            Palace. This magnificent palace is the official residence of the British monarch and has been the backdrop
            for many royal events and ceremonies. If you're a budget traveller looking for a royal experience, then
            Buckingham Palace is a must-visit attraction.\nBuilt in 1703, Buckingham Palace has undergone several
            renovations and expansions over the years. The palace has 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 royal and
            guest bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. The palace is also home to the famous
            Changing of the Guard ceremony, which takes place daily during the summer months and every other day during
            the winter.\nVisiting Buckingham Palace is an experience that is sure to leave you in awe. The palace's
            grandeur and opulence are evident in every corner, from the intricate details of the architecture to the
            stunning works of art that adorn the walls. The State Rooms are the main highlight of the palace, and
            visitors can explore the Throne Room, the Ballroom, and the Picture Gallery, among others.\nOne of the best
            things about visiting Buckingham Palace is the opportunity to witness the Changing of the Guard ceremony.
            This is a tradition that dates back to the 17th century and involves the ceremonial changing of the guards
            who protect the palace. The ceremony is a spectacle to behold, with the guards dressed in their iconic red
            tunics and bearskin hats, marching to the beat of a military band.\nAside from the State Rooms and the
            Changing of the Guard ceremony, visitors can also explore the palace gardens, which cover an area of 39
            acres. The gardens are a tranquil oasis in the heart of the city, with beautiful flower beds, a lake, and
            even a tennis court.\nIn conclusion, Buckingham Palace is a must-visit attraction for budget travellers who
            want to experience a slice of royal life. The palace's rich history, stunning architecture, and beautiful
            gardens are sure to leave you with lasting memories. So, if you're planning a trip to London, make sure to
