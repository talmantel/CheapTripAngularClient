              The carnival is the largest carnival in Scandinavia. The Aalborg Carnival stands for a
              week and has three main carnival events: The Grand Parade, Battle of Carnival Bands
              and Children’s Carnival. The carnival week is for everyone – both professional
              carnival groups, children and everybody who wants to act on his or her instincts and
              create their own costume and join the celebration of life.
