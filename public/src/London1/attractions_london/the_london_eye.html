            The London Eye: A Must-Visit Attraction for Budget Travellers\nIf you're looking for a unique and
            unforgettable experience in London, then the London Eye should be at the top of your list. This iconic
            attraction is a giant Ferris wheel that offers breathtaking views of the city's skyline and landmarks. But
            the London Eye is more than just a ride; it's a symbol of London's modernity, innovation and diversity.\nThe
            London Eye was opened in 2000 to celebrate the new millennium and has since become one of the most popular
            tourist attractions in the world. It stands at 135 meters tall and has 32 capsules that can hold up to 25
            people each. The ride takes about 30 minutes to complete, giving you plenty of time to enjoy the panoramic
            views of London.\nOne of the main highlights of the London Eye is the views. From the top, you can see some
            of London's most famous landmarks, such as Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, St. Paul's
            Cathedral, and the Shard. The views are especially stunning at sunset or at night when the city is lit
            up.\nBut the London Eye is not just about the views. There are also plenty of activities and experiences to
            enjoy. For example, you can book a private capsule for a romantic date or a special occasion. You can also
            enjoy a glass of champagne or a meal while taking in the views. And if you're feeling adventurous, you can
            try the 4D cinema experience, which takes you on a virtual tour of London.\nVisiting the London Eye is not
            just about the activities and experiences; it's also about the emotions. The ride is a thrilling and
            exhilarating experience that will leave you with a sense of awe and wonder. You'll feel like you're floating
            above the city, and the views will take your breath away.\nIn conclusion, the London Eye is a must-visit
            attraction for budget travellers who want to experience the best of London. It offers stunning views,
            exciting activities, and unforgettable emotions. So, if you're planning a trip to London, make sure to add
